## About

This paper has been submitted for publication in the journal *Computers & Geosciences*.

This repository contains the source code to perform the two synthetic tests presented. The codes `euler_python.py`, the synthetic data `synthetic_data.dat` presented in the paper and the codes `synthetic_test.py`, `estimates_statistics.py` and `plot_functions` to generate the results of the synthetic test.

The *euler_python* program is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.7 programming language.
 
## Abstract

We propose a novel methodology to select reliable Euler deconvolution estimates throughout the vertical derivatives in the sensitivity matrix. For each moving data window, we compute the standard deviation of the vertical derivatives in the sensitivity matrix. The moving data windows with the largest standard deviations of the vertical derivatives define the location of the sources and thus reliable estimates. Traditionally, for each tentative structural index (SI), the horizontal coordinates estimates obtained for each position of a moving data window are plotted in the plan view of the study area and the depth estimates are represented by different colors. Therefore, in our methodology, the estimates with tight clustering define the correct SI. Furthermore, we plot the horizontal coordinates estimates obtained for each position of a moving data window in the plan view of the study area and the base-level estimates represented by different colors in order to analyze these estimates when the correct SI is used. We prove the success of our methodology in two scenarios. First, four sources with distinct SI generate the total-field anomaly that is corrupted by an additive nonlinear background. This background strongly interfere the anomalies, changing their amplitude and shape. Second, we simulate two nearby sources generating a strongly interfering anomaly. In this case, the resulting anomaly is not visually distinguishable as generated by more than one source. In both cases, our methodology correctly defines the SIs and the depths of the causative sources. We apply our methodology to the real magnetic anomaly of Anitápolis, Brazil, and we may infer that a plug generates the Anitápolis anomaly.

## Content

- euler_python.py:
	General Python module containing the functions to compute de derivatives and 
	Euler deconvolution.
	
- synthetic_test.py:
	Python script to generate the synthetic results. The script loads the total-field
	anomaly of a synthetic model from the file "synthetic_data.dat" and computes the
	Euler deconvolution using the functions in "euler_python.py". The results are 
	generated using the functions "plot_functions.py" for the plots and 
	"estimates_statistics.py" to compute the statistics of the data.
	
- plot_functions.py:
	Python script to generate the figures in the synthetic tests results. 
	
- estimates_statistics.py:
	Python script to compute the mean of the depth estimates. 	
	
Test data:

- synthetic_data.dat:
		Synthetic total-field anomaly data generated using the Python packaged
		"Fatiando a Terra": http://fatiando.org/. This data is an example used
		in the current publication.

## Getting the code

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ffigura/Euler-deconvolution-python.git

or [download a zip archive](https://github.com/ffigura/Euler-deconvolution-python/archive/master.zip).


## Dependencies

The Python program Euler deconvolution - "euler_python.py" requires the Python library "numpy", 
the scripts "synthetic_test.py" and "plot_functions.py" require the Python packages "numpy"
and "matplotlib", and the script "estimates_statistics.py" requires the Python package "numpy".
The easier way to get Python and all libraries installed is through the Anaconda Python 
distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). After installed Anaconda, install the libraries 
by running the following command in your terminal:

	conda install numpy matplotlib

The program for Euler deconvolution "euler_python.py" and the additional codes "synthetic_test.py",
"plot_functions.py" and "estimates_statistics.py" are compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.7.

## Reproducing the results

The results and figures for the synthetic test are reproducible from the folders `/test_4_sources` and 
`/test_2_sources`.
Running the code `synthetic_test.py` will allow the reprodution of the results. For more information
read the file `README.MD` or `README.txt` in the folder `/code`.
