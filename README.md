We compare the classic and the plateau plots of Euler deconvolution estimates for gridded data to interpret magnetic anomaly. This work is a further step to clarify how these plots work in defining the source-position estimates in Euler deconvolution. We also show an application to the real magnetic data Anitápolis, southern Brazil, and infer the that a plug is the causative source.
 
## Abstract

Euler deconvolution is a popular method for interpretation of potential-field data. 
The method estimates the position of a geologic source and the data background (base level)
based on the magnetic or gravimetric data, for a given nature (i.e., structural index – SI).
These estimates are computed using a moving data-window scheme spanning the whole dataset. 
The selection of the best estimates uses the plot of these estimates. Traditionally, for each 
SI, the horizontal coordinates estimates obtained for each position of a moving data window 
are plotted in the plan view of the study area and the depth estimates are represented by different
color. This plot requires a statistical criterion to select the best estimates for each SI. In this
case, mostly, the base-level estimates are computed but they are neither used nor shown. Henceforth,
this traditional representation of Euler solution will be referred to as “classic plot” of Euler 
solutions. We compare the classic plot with an alternative plot of Euler estimates (henceforth referred
to “plateau plot” of Euler solutions). In the plateau plot, for each SI, every Euler estimate is 
displayed against the central position of the moving data window. At plateau plot, when the correct
SI is used the horizontal, depth and base-level estimates form a plateau of constant values over the
source. We compare the visualization of Euler deconvolution estimates using classic and plateau plots
through synthetic data generated by two sources with distinct SI, obtaining similar results. In addition,
we plot the base-level estimates in the classic and traditional way to perform the comparison. We also
compare these visualizations of solutions by applying Euler deconvolution to the real magnetic anomaly
of Anitápolis in southern Brazil. Either classic or plateau plots of Euler estimates yields similar 
results and we may infer that a plug generates the Anitápolis anomaly.

## Software implementation


The algorithm was developed in Python and it is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.7.
The source code `euler_python.py` used to generate the results in the paper is in
the folder `code/`.
The reproducible synthetic example is in the folder `code/synthetic_test/`.
The results can be obtaind with the code
`synthetic_euler_python.py`, which uses the source code `euler_python.py` and the data `synthetic_data.dat`.
The estimates and statistics are saved in `code/synthetic_test/output` and the 
figures in `code/synthetic_test/figures/`. The true results, for comparison, are
stored in `code/synthetic_test/true_results/figures/` and `code/synthetic_test/true_results/output/`
See the `README.md` files in each directory for a full description.

## Dependencies

The Python program Euler deconvolution - "euler_python.py" requires the Python library "numpy" 
and the script "synthetic_euler_python.py" requires the Python packages "numpy" and "matplotlib". 
The easier way to get Python and all libraries installed is through the Anaconda Python 
distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). After installed Anaconda, install the libraries 
by running the following command in your terminal:

	conda install numpy matplotlib

The program for Euler deconvolution "euler_python.py" and the algorithm "synthetic_euler_python.py"
 are compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.7.

## Reproducing the results

The results and figures for the synthetic test are reproducible from the folder `code/synthetic_test/`.
Ruuning the code `synthetic_euler_python.py` will allow the reprodution of the results. For more information
read the file `README.MD` or `README.txt` in the folder `code`.
